## Article XIV: Role
1. The General Assembly (GA), consisting of all active members, is the highest sovereign organ of the association, which determines and controls the activities of the association. It automatically takes all decisions that are not the responsibility of the board, by law and the statutes, with its primary functions consisting of:  
  &emsp;a. Electing the Board.  
  &emsp;b. Approving the budget.  
  &emsp;c. Expelling a member.  
  &emsp;d. Approving any amendments to the statutes.  
  &emsp;e. Proposing events.  
  &emsp;f. Closing the current accounting year and opens the next.  
  &emsp;g. Appointing each year a control body (an auditor), which acts independently of the board.  
  &emsp;h. Approving the reports of the board, the annual accounts, and balance sheets.  
  &emsp;i. Releasing the Board from its obligations towards the association at the end of its term.  
  &emsp;j. Issuing an opinion on any proposal appearing on the agenda emanating from the board or member.  

## Article XV: Operation
1. The GA is split into two types of general meetings:  
  &emsp;a. The Primary General Assembly (GA)  
  &emsp;b. The Secondary General Assembly (Sec. GA), which is limited to discussing the current situation of the organization, planning as well as updating the members on future events. The Sec. GA is not concerned with electing a new board - only with approving board chosen replacements, if necessarily.  
2. The Primary GA is convened once a year at the beginning of the autumn semester, taking place regardless of the number of present members.
3. The Secondary GA is convened at least once a year at the beginning of the spring semester, taking place regardless of the number of present members
4. The GA may be convened at the request of at least 25 percent of active members or by the decision of the Board.
5. The Board publishes the assembly agenda at least three days before the GA and at least one week before the Sec. GA.
6. All active and honorary members have the right to make proposals and attend the GA.
7. Proposals made by members may be communicated to the Board in writing up until 3 days before a GA and can then be added to the agenda.

1. At the beginning of the GA, a vote counter(s) is(are) appointed and fixed in the protocol.
2. Each working member has the right to vote at the GA and has one vote.
3. The Board is responsible for checking the right to vote of those present before the GA starts.

5. Voting is done non-anonymously unless two or more members request an anonymous vote.
